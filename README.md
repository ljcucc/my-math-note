# My math note

this math note is applied to the template: https://github.com/ljcucc/math_note_template

## Notetaking style

This note is taken by a conversational way, two character talking to each other.
chapter are categorized by subject, and sections are categorized by topics,
instead of struct contents.

Each section or subsection is separated as much as possible to help with organization and categorization.
But I still hope that the topics can be connected or referenced to each other at some level.
(Like each episode of a cartoon)

Used font: [LXGW WenKai TC](https://fonts.google.com/?query=LXGW) (to match the handwriting styles I expected that I used to be writing.)
